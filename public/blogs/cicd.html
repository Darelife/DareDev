<h1>CI CD Pipelines</h1>
CI/CD stands for "Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment".
Now, it's all about making a proper workflow that tests whether the software is
working correctly, and initiates the deployment process. So today, lets check
out how to use github actions to implement this easily.
<br />
<br />
So first of all, it comes down to the file structure.
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>.github/workflows/</strong>: This is the directory where all your
    GitHub Actions workflow files will reside.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>main.yml</strong>: This is an example workflow file that defines the
    steps for your CI/CD pipeline.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my <code>main.yml</code> file for this website:</p>
<pre>
<code>
name: Build Check

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "18"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run build
        run: npm run build

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy application
        run: echo "Deploying application..."
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  This workflow will trigger on every push/pr to all the branches, 
  (though we could also specify the branch, as you'll see in the example below),
  install dependencies, and check if it builds. I dont need to do anything else
  in this project atleast as it's just a frontend project. And most of the
  times, there's just a random build error. You can also make the
  <code>on</code> parameter look like this
<pre>
<code>
on:
push:
  branches:
    - main
pull_request:
  branches:
    - main
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Explaining the YML File</h2>
<p>
  This file defines a GitHub Actions workflow for automating tasks like
  building and deploying your application. Let's break down the major
  components.
</p>
<h3>Name: Workflow Name</h3>
<p>
  This defines the name of the workflow as it appears in the GitHub Actions UI.
  In this case, it's: <code>Build Check</code>.
</p>
<h3>On: Trigger Events</h3>
<p>
  This tells GitHub when to run the workflow. You can specify events like
  <code>push</code>, <code>pull_request</code>, etc. In this, you can also 
  specify the branch it's supposed to work on.
</p>
<h3>Jobs: Define Individual Tasks</h3> 
<p> 
  Each job is a set of steps that runs in the specified environment. In our case, 
  there are two jobs: <code>build</code> and <code>deploy</code>. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>runs-on</code></strong>: This tells GitHub which VM to use. In this
    case, we chose the latest Ubuntu virtual environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>steps</code></strong>: They just consist of the name, 
    and the terminal command based on the VM selected.
  </li>
</ul>
